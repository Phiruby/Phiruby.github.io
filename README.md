# Data Analysis For Marketing
This was a project alongside Mu Sigma Inc. to analyze LinkedIn data to create more engaging posts.

#### About this Repository
The repository is a small glimpse on the project. This shows a small sample size of the larger data that was collected, and helps the team visualize their
global audience distribution.  This is a way to interact with the map and click on nodes to view specific information about the audience.

The full recommendations and actions took to improve media engagement is not a part of this repository. This presentation is not included in this repository; however, the recommendations that were provided using data analysis certainly helped increase followership by 20%.
